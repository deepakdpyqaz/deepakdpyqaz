## About Me
I am currently working as a software engineer at Flipkart. I pursued B.tech in Computer science (AI) from Netaji Subash University of Technology Delhi. I had experience in working as a software developer in ION and as a backend developer in winzo games. I am interested in AI specially deep neural networks. I love challenges and is always ready to find out the most simple and effective solutions for them. My skills include python, django, flask, react js and tensorflow.

I love watching and playing cricket and am also very fond of travelling and visiting to new places. I always want to explore whether it is new things or new technologies.
